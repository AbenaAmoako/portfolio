        <div class="theproblem">
            <h3>the problem.</h3>
            <p>The client was not entirely happy about the current website. <br> In a year, they only received approximately 60 engagements from their website. <br> Of course, they were satisfied with the traction they had in the physical shops, <br> but they preferred the bonus of a more refined online presence. <br><br> These were the apparent issues with the current website: <br> 
         <b> 1.</b> There were too many icons which contributed to a high bounce rate <br> <br><b> 2.</b> The wayfinding navigation required in a smooth UI Design was missing. 
           <br> Hence, the user would be left confused and frustrated. <br> <br>
           <b>3.</b>  There was no direct provision to make purchases online. <br> Users from the website would still have to call or send a message to place an order. <br><a style="font-size: 1.3rem;" href="https://aspenflora.com/">www.aspenflora.com</a> </p>

        <div class="line">
            <h2>Empathize</h2>
        <p>The client was right in making the observation that their online presence did not reflect the physical store entirely. For instance, they were a successful business mainly due to their affordable prices. However on the online store, the showcased products were quite expensive which could serve as a deterrent. <br> 
            Secondly, users were usually repeat customers who consistently benefitted from an enjoyable and intimate experience from the client. Whilst it was necessary to maintain this, it was agreed that the online store could be the perfect avenue to find and retain new users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="line">
        <h2>Define</h2>
        <p>The task required a brainstorming session to better understand the client's goals and validate the users' goals. Several materials were used to achieve this goal. They include (but are not limited to): Social media platforms and websites of small and large competitors,  Reading materials primarily from Google Scholar and O'reilly <br> Youtube insights on online flower businesses
       The most profound articles have been listed here : <br> Yusuf Gezer, Said Kingir: Entrepreneurs' Decision Processes On A New Business Investment: Feasibility Study In London Flower Industry, Academic Review of Humanities and Social Sciences, (2020) 3(1). <br>

        <h3>user pain points.</h3>
            <p>Data was collected through contextual inquiry. <br> 25 user interviews occured over a span of two days. <br>
            After the brainstorming session, it was validated by users visiting the store that indeed: <br>
        They usually purchased flowers for other people such as family members and close friends. <br> Half of the users also mentioned that they purchased flowers simply to take home, with no special occasion in mind. <br> Out of the 25 users that were spoken to, 18 of them were repeat customers. They were between the ages of 23 and 65 </p>

        <h3>ideate</h3>
            <p>UX Strategy, Specific Features and Interesting Insights</p>
            <p>- Reduce the icons on website <br>- The website should have minimal text and a more detailed user flow. <br> - only adequate information to suit the user's needs is required.</p>
            <p>Considering the fact that most users were millenials, <br>
            accessibility research on what appeals to them shows that more images and less text would be necessary. <br> Also, this should result in a cleaner interface. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="images">
         <h3>User flow</h3>

         <h3>The Prototype</h3>
    <img style="width: 30rem;" src="wireframe.png" alt="wireframe">
</div>
    <div class="challenge">
    <h3>the challenge</h3>
    <p>This wireframe was rejected by the client. In fact, the client decided on a new outcome where the website would be used for bulk and custom orders - Occasions only.</p>
    <p>So I curated a website with said desire. This was a challenge because it went against all the research and time put into the project when at the same time, I was in the early stages of perfecting my craft in HTML and CSS. </p> 
    <a style="font-size: 1.5rem;" href="https://abenaamoako.github.io/1sttrial/">Website take</a>
    <p>The decision to focus on occasions did not entirely solve the problem. A high bounce rate was inevitable and an online flower shop to attract new clients as proposed initially was still the goal for the client. This was an interesting insight because by creating a website they wished for, it was easier to obtain a client buy in and defend my design decisions to produce the final product:</p>
    <a style="font-size: 1.5rem;" href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/GET STARTED/GETTING STARTED/portpro.html">View Iterated Website Here</a>
<p>In all honesty, the website has been iterated 5 times since the inception of the project. The other takes are not worth including as I was a beginner at the time and not work I am entirely proud of but I am definitely proud of the progress I have made so far and look forward to my potential, given a little more push.</p>
